# WARNING
This repository is not yet ready.

This repository is super-prototyped.

There were many "hacks" to cheat over the WebStorm, the IDE I'm using.

I really hate JSON files so I used Makefiles instead.

Distribution files are produced by Gulp. The Gulpfile are super-hacky. I'll have to workaround the Riot.js compiler's issue.

Be aware, build errors are expected.
